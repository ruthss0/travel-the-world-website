      <p>The best travel quotes are often the deepest and most powerful. As a travel blogger, I always look to travel quotes for guidance, wanderlust, and inspiration. For years, I’ve been collecting quotes about travel while traveling the world, and always enjoy reflecting on them in my day-to-day life. Everyone has a different lens through which they view the world, which is why it’s important to heed the advice and insight of others.</p>

          "I was engulfed by a sense of being trapped in a remote place.

          Needless to say, I reached Brunei in a pretty foul mood. I think one of the things that struck me the most even in the midst of that bad mood was the large swaths of greenery that surrounded us.
          
          Mind you, we were not staying in the big city but as far away on the outskirts as you could imagine. I’m not a city girl by any stretch and the greenery eventually soothed my nerves."
